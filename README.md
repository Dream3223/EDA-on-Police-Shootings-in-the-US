# Police Shooting Analysis

Suicide Rates Around the World from 1985-2015

## Description

The main purpose of analyzing police shootings from 2015-2020 in the United States is to determine if there are any patterns with individuals involved in the shootings, whether it's with race, location, mental stability, etc. The goals of this research are to simply examine the variables related to fatal police shootings and determine any sort of correlations or patterns between them. For most of the data analysis/exploration, since the majority of variables are characters and not numeric, I'll be using xtabs functions, giving the totals of each variable given another variable. I'll also be showing percentages when it seems beneficial for clarity or further examination of the variables in question.

This is a research project from 2020, I may or may not contribute to it again but I needed to perform some cleaning up and formatting adjustments for it to be GitHub compatible and I'm uploading it for viewing.

To simply view, open the Police-Shootings-in-the-US.md file.
